## Part I: Jenss-Bayley Latent Change Score Model with Individual Ratio of Growth Acceleration in the Framework of Individual Measurement Occasions
**Manuscript Title:** <br>
Jenss-Bayley Latent Change Score Model with Individual Ratio of Growth Acceleration in the Framework of Individual
Measurement Occasions

**Description:** <br>
In this part, we extend an existing LCSM with the Jenss-Bayley growth curve and propose a novel expression of change scores that allows for (1) unequally-spaced study waves and (2) individual measurement occasions around each wave. We also extend the existing model to estimate the individual ratio of growth acceleration (that largely determines the trajectory shape and is viewed as the most important parameter in the Jenss-Bayley model).

- Jenss-Bayley Latent Change Score Model with Fixed Ratio of Growth Acceleration

**Demo:** 
- [*R* package: *OpenMx*](https://github.com/Veronica0206/LCSM_projects/blob/main/Part%201/OpenMx_demo1.md)
(For OS, R version, and OpenMx version, see the demo)

Will upload later.

## Part II: Parallel Latent Basis Growth Model in the Framework of Individual Measurement Occasions
**Manuscript Title:** <br>
Extending Latent Basis Growth Model to Explore Joint Development in the Framework of Individual Measurement Occasions

**Description:** <br>
In this part, we propose a novel specification for LBGMs that allows for (1) unequally-spaced study waves and (2) individual measurement occasions around each wave. We then extend LBGMs to explore multiple repeated outcomes because longitudinal processes rarely unfold in isolation.
